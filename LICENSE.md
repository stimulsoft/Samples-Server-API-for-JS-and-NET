### STIMULSOFT BI SERVER LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Stimulsoft, ("STIMULSOFT") Server License Agreement ("SLA") is a legal agreement between you ("CUSTOMER") and STIMULSOFT for STIMULSOFT BI SERVER identified above and including software, demos, intermediate files, media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE") contained in this installation file.

STIMULSOFT grants to CUSTOMER, a personal, nonexclusive license to install and use the SOFTWARE for the sole purposes of testing, creating, designing, and sharing reports, dashboards, and forms which CUSTOMER creates.

By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, CUSTOMER agrees to be bound by the terms of this SLA. If CUSTOMER does not agree to any part of the terms of this SLA, DO NOT INSTALL, USE, DISTRIBUTE IN ANY MANNER, OR REPLICATE IN ANY MANNER, ANY PART, FILE OR PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE.

All SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold.

The license is perpetual. The license granted does not have an expiration date and continues indefinitely unless terminated by one of the parties according to the terms outlined in the agreement.

### ACTIVATION
SOFTWARE is delivered as the installation package. Until activation, SOFTWARE operates as a trial version. After its activation, it operates as a registered version. Activation can be done using the credentials that will be sent after purchase. After applying the credentials, SOFTWARE will send a request to the Stimulsoft Activation Server and activate the software. SOFTWARE is activated on one particular server (computer) and is automatically linked to it after activation.

If CUSTOMER wants to transfer the installation to another server, CUSTOMER should deactivate the current server installation, and then activate the SOFTWARE on the new server.

### SERVER CREATORS AND USERS
SOFTWARE licensing depends on the number of creators. A creator is a person who has an account on the server, has access from the client-side, registered as an editor, and uses the product to work with report templates dashboards, and forms - create, edit, view, delete, etc.

A SOFTWARE user is a person who has an account on the server, is registered as a user, and uses the product to view rendered reports and dashboards.

SOFTWARE is delivered with a minimum package for 1 (one) creator. This means that 1 (one) creator can simultaneously be connected to the server and use a specific server installation.

For this, the CUSTOMER should pay the difference between the cost of the current license and the cost of the license the CUSTOMER wants to upgrade to.
