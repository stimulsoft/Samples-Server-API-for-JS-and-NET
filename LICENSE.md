### STIMULSOFT SERVER LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Stimulsoft, ("STIMULSOFT") Server License Agreement ("SLA") is a legal agreement between you ("CUSTOMER") and STIMULSOFT for STIMULSOFT SERVER identified above and including software, components, source code (if provided), demos, intermediate files, media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE") contained in this installation file.

STIMULSOFT grants to you, a personal, nonexclusive license to install and use the SOFTWARE for the sole purposes of designing, developing, testing, and deploying reports which you create.

By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms of this SLA. If you do not agree to any part of the terms of this SLA, DO NOT INSTALL, USE, DISTRIBUTE IN ANY MANNER, OR REPLICATE IN ANY MANNER, ANY PART, FILE OR PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE.

All SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold.

The license is perpetual. The purchased product can be used as long as needed.

### ACTIVATION
SOFTWARE is delivered as the installation package. Until activation, SOFTWARE operates as a trial version. After its activation it operates as a registered version. Activation can be done using the credentials that will be sent after purchase. After applying the credentials, SOFTWARE will send request to Stimulsoft Activation Server and activate the software. SOFTWARE is activated on one particular server (computer) and is automatically linked to it after activation.

If you want to transfer the installation to another server, you should deactivate the current server installation. Then activate SOFTWARE on new server.

### USERS
SOFTWARE licensing depends on the number of users. The user is a person who has a created account on the server, connects to it from a client, registered there as a user and uses SOFTWARE for working with reports.

SOFTWARE is delivered with a minimum package for 10 users. This means that up to 10 users (including the administrator) can simultaneously be connected to the server and use a specific server installation.

If it is necessary to use our product for more users, then it is possible to switch the current license on the license for greater number of users. For this the CUSTOMER should pay the difference between the cost of the current license and the cost of the license the CUSTOMER wants to upgrade on.
